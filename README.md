# Amazon Clone

The project is built using React and is deployed on Firebase. You can see the deployed project [Here](https://clone-b7a06.web.app/ "Named link title")

# Description

The Amazon clone is a web application that replicates the look and feel of the popular e-commerce site Amazon. The app includes many of the features that users have come to expect from Amazon, such as:

- Product listings
- Shopping cart
- Checkout process
- User authentication

# Usage

To use the Amazon clone, simply go to the deployed project URL. The app will load and show you a replica of the Amazon homepage. From there, you can browse products, add them to your cart, and complete the checkout process. You can also create an account or sign in to an existing account to save your information and view your order history.

# Development

To run the Amazon clone locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/amazon-clone.git

The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000/. You can make changes to the code and see them reflected in the app.
